<strong>Hydrotalcite (CAS 11097-59-9) Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Hydrotalcite is a Layered Double Hydroxide whose name is derived from its resemblance with talc and its high water content. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) comprise an unusual class of layered materials with positively charged hydroxide layers and charge balancing, mobile anions located in the interlayer region. This structure gives these material anion-exchange properties. The natural form of hydrotalcite is mined in small quantities in the Snarum area of Norway and the Ural area of Russia. Carl Christian Hochstetter (1842) was the first to report about hydrotalcite, which was attached firmly to a schist. He described a white material with a pearl like luster, with the formula Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3 . 4H2O.
