Connections between high power supply sources and electrical devices can be made in two ways: either hardwiring the connection between the source and the device or using standardized plugs and sockets. Since connecting and removing the electricity supply between hardwired devices, which need to be moved/disconnected regularly, is a cumbersome process, industrial plugs and sockets are used in such applications. Industrial plugs and sockets provide a safe and convenient method of connection between two electrical circuits.
Industrial plugs and sockets are utilized in low voltage and current industrial applications (lower than the utility requirement) to provide electrical connections in manufacturing facilities, such as the automobile industry, shipbuilding yards, and aircraft manufacturing. These are usually designed to withstand rugged use and the harsh conditions that are encountered in these workplaces.
